What is SQL?

SQL stands for Structured Query Language  

SQL lets you access and manipulate databases  

SQL became a standard of the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) in 1986, and of the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) in 1987  

What can SQL Do?  

SQL can execute queries against a database  

SQL can retrieve data from a database  

SQL can insert records in a database  

SQL can update records in a database  

SQL can delete records from a database  

SQL can create new databases  

SQL can create new tables in a database  
SQL can create stored procedures in a database  

SQL can create views in a database  

SQL can set permissions on tables, procedures, and views  

Some of The Most Important SQL Commands:  

SELECT - extracts data from a database  

UPDATE - updates data in a database  

DELETE - deletes data from a database  

INSERT INTO - inserts new data into a database  

CREATE DATABASE - creates a new database  

ALTER DATABASE - modifies a database  

CREATE TABLE - creates a new table  

ALTER TABLE - modifies a table  

DROP TABLE - deletes a table  

CREATE INDEX - creates an index (search key)  

DROP INDEX - deletes an index  

I have taken a sample database table Customer whose fields are -  

CustomerName, ContactName, Address, City, PostalCode, Country.  

I have taken a sample database table Products which fields are - ProductID, ProductName, SupplierID, CategoryID, Unit, Price.  

I have taken a sample database table OrderDetails which fields are - OrderDetailID, OrderID, ProductID, Quantity  

I have taken a sample database table Orders which fields are - OrderID, CustomerID, EmployeeID, OrderDate, ShipperID.  

SQL JOIN ?  

A JOIN clause is used to combine rows from two or more tables, based on a related column between them.  

Let's look at a selection from the "Orders" table:  

OrderID	CustomerID	OrderDate  
10308	2	1996-09-18  
10309	37	1996-09-19  
10310	77	1996-09-20  

Then, look at a selection from the "Customers" table:  

CustomerID	CustomerName	ContactName	Country  
1	Alfreds Futterkiste	Maria Anders	Germany  
2	Ana Trujillo Emparedados y helados	Ana Trujillo	Mexico  
3	Antonio Moreno Taquer√≠a	Antonio Moreno	Mexico  

Notice that the "CustomerID" column in the "Orders" table refers to the "CustomerID" in the "Customers" table. The relationship between the two tables above is the "CustomerID" column.  

Then, we can create the following SQL statement (that contains an INNER JOIN), that selects records that have matching values in both tables:  

Different Types of SQL JOINs ?  

Here are the different types of the JOINs in SQL:  

(INNER) JOIN: Returns records that have matching values in both tables  

LEFT (OUTER) JOIN: Returns all records from the left table, and the matched records from the right table  

RIGHT (OUTER) JOIN: Returns all records from the right table, and the matched records from the left table  

FULL (OUTER) JOIN: Returns all records when there is a match in either left or right table
